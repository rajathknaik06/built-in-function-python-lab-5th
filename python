""" There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly. 



Given a string of words separated by a single space and a string of broken letters, of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in the text you can fully type using this keyboard. 



Example: 

Input: text = "hello world", broken Letters = "AD" 

Output: 1 



Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken. 

Input format :
The first line contains the input string separated by spaces.

The second line contains a single string of all broken keyboard characters. 

Output format :
The number of words that can be printed fully."""
